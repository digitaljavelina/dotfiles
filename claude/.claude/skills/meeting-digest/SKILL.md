description: >-
  Turn a meeting or voice recording (or a transcript) that lives on disk into a
  structured digest note: TL;DR, decisions, action items with owners, and open
  questions. Use when Michael points at a recording or transcript file and says
  "digest this meeting", "summarize this recording", "turn this call into notes",
  "what were the action items from this". Runs entirely locally on the Claude Code
  subscription: local whisper for audio, Claude for the structuring, no external
  API. This is the domain-neutral sibling of matter-intake (which is for legal
  client intake). For distilling the CURRENT chat conversation rather than a file
  on disk, use chatdistill instead.

# meeting-digest

Digest one recording or transcript that already lives on the machine into a
clean, skimmable note. One skill, one bundled script, Claude does the thinking.
Local only, no app, no cloud, no API bill.

This is the general-purpose sibling of `matter-intake`. Same local pipeline,
different output shape:
- `matter-intake` -> legal client-intake matter summary (seven sections)
- `meeting-digest` -> a domain-neutral meeting digest (this skill)

If the task is to distill the conversation already open in this chat, that is
`chatdistill`, not this. This skill is for a file on disk.

## Where output goes

Default: write the digest next to the source recording, named
`<recording-name>.digest.md`. This is the safe default because some recordings
(for example work meetings) may be confidential and should not auto-sync to the
iCloud Obsidian vault.

If Michael wants it in the vault, he can pass an `output_dir` under
`/Users/michaelhenry/Obsidian/` (Inbox/ is the usual drop zone) or say so. Do not
put plausibly-confidential content (anything work or employer related) into the
synced vault without him asking.

## Step 1 - get a transcript

Run the bundled script on whatever path was given. It detects audio vs text:
audio is transcribed locally with mlx-whisper, text passes straight through.

```bash
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/prepare_transcript.sh" "<input path>" "<optional output_dir>"
```

It prints one line, `TRANSCRIPT=<path>`. Read that file. If it reports no
transcriber, relay the one-line hint and stop.

Speaker note: local whisper does not separate speakers. Attribute points to a
person only where the wording makes it obvious. Otherwise keep them neutral.

## Step 2 - structure into the digest

Read the transcript and write the digest using this structure. Stay grounded in
what was actually said. If a section is empty, write "None" rather than padding.

```markdown
# Meeting digest - <short topic> - <date if known>

> Generated from an inferred-speaker transcript. Verify before relying on it.

## TL;DR
- <three bullets max, the "if you read nothing else" version>

## Decisions
- <what was actually decided, not what was discussed>

## Action items
- [ ] <item> - owner - due

## Open questions / parking lot
- <unresolved threads, things deferred>

## Notes by topic
- <short outline of what was covered, grouped by theme>
```

Put owners and due dates on action items wherever they were stated. Where an
owner is unclear, write "owner: unassigned" so it is visibly a gap.

## Step 3 - write and report

Write the file (default next to the input, or the `output_dir` arg). Tell
Michael the path, the count of decisions, and the count of action items (and how
many have an owner). Keep the content in the file, not pasted into a long chat.

If he asks for a PDF, convert with pandoc:

```bash
pandoc "<digest>.md" -o "<digest>.pdf"
```

## Scope

One recording at a time. Local only. Domain-neutral. No app, no cloud backend.
For legal client intake use `matter-intake`. For the current chat use
`chatdistill`.
